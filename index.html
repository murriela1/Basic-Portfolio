							<h3 class="description">I was born and raised in Manalapan, New Jersey. I have one sister who is a stay at home mom, and gave birth to twin boys which are a big part of the families life. My father works on a high yield bond trading floor, and my mother works as a fertility gynec nurse. I went to college at Towson University, and graduated with BS in Finance in 2009. In October, 2009, I started a temp. position at the financial clearing firm that I still work at, Pershing LLC. I applied internally while still on contract, and was hired for an entry level position in Custody Department. After working for five years in the custody department, I applied internally and started at a position for the International Settlements Department in August, 2015. That is the role that I am currently in. I decided to apply to Rutgers Coding Bootcamp because my job does not fulfill my creativity needs, and I feel that computer programming will provide that for me. I don't mind the repitition that goes along with programming, as I enjoy that at my current role. Bottom line, I am looking for a career change and looking to give 110%</h3>
